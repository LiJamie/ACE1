You have no notes here yet. To get started, set your Synchronization preferences under Settings. There are two synchronization options described below.

Online Synchronization
Online Synchronization is what you are looking for if you want to sync to Tomboy-Online, Ubuntu One, your own Snowy server or any server supporting the Tomboy Web REST API.

To use it, set Sync Service to Online Synchronization in preferences then provide a Server URL. Here are some of the public ones:
Tomboy Online - https://edge.tomboy-online.org/
Ubuntu One - https://one.ubuntu.com/notes

Once set, hit the Sync logo on Tomdroid's top bar to synchronize your notes.

Note: you might want to back up your Tomboy notes before syncing, since this app is still under development and may corrupt your Tomboy notes. The notes can be found in ~/.local/share/tomboy/ on Linux.

SD Card
Put your Tomboy notes (*.note) on your SD Card under tomdroid/. The notes can be found in ~/.local/share/tomboy/ on Linux. Once the notes are copied, set Sync Service to SD Card in preferences then hit the Sync logo on Tomdroid's top bar.

See http://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/Directories for the notes' location on other platforms.

Also, Tomdroid is always looking for new contributors. If you are interested join the tomdroid-dev team on launchpad: http://launchpad.net/~tomdroid-dev.

Lastly, if you encounter any issue, please report it at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/tomdroid index=1\")
